# Thesis_unused

This is 2 other idea for my thesis, but this is categorized as supervised learning because this algorithm need all of the data to be labelled

Both algortihm have better accuracy and by using small number of data (add 1,000-ish data) it gain almost similar with the model with 10,000 train data.
